# Leaving for Greener Pastures: Why South San Francisco High School Teachers Move to Neighboring Districts
 
By Julietta Bisharyan

When Erik Migdail opened his first paycheck from Carlmont High School, he was certain there had been an error. 

His earnings were about one and a half times higher than what he earned at South San Francisco High School, where he had started his teaching career 16 years ago. He confronted the human resources department, but was assured by staff that his take-home pay was correct.

Dubbed the “training ground of the Peninsula,” many teachers working at South San Francisco High School (SSFHS) end up moving to neighboring districts just a short 20-minute drive away. 

For high school teachers, South San Francisco Unified School District (SSFUSD) offers one of the lowest paying salaries in San Mateo County. In the past decade, about 14% of teachers have left each year either due to the Bay Area’s high cost of living or for better pay, according to exit surveys. 

This teacher exodus reflects a larger issue of systemic deficiencies in the state's education funding. These shortcomings have contributed to a lack of equity in the opportunities available to both teachers and students.

South San Francisco, known as the birthplace of biotechnology, harbors a working-class community with a median household income of $106,005 per year, about $41,000 above the national average. Despite the city’s booming biotech industry and the high school’s state-of-the-art science labs, the district struggles to compete against neighboring districts in Hillsborough and Atherton, which offer significantly higher salaries due to their location in some of California's wealthiest zip codes. 

The district also faces the Bay Area’s housing affordability issue in retaining quality teachers. Though plans for staff housing have been approved, it remains a barrier for teachers hoping to one day own property.

Currently, South San Francisco Unified School District has a teacher starting salary of $59,784. By comparison, new teachers at neighboring districts are earning 27% more at the start of their careers.

Even if an experienced teacher from South San Francisco High School changes schools and cannot transfer their entire years of service, switching to a district with higher pay could still result in a pay bump. In other words, a teacher who has worked for nine years at South San Francisco High School would still earn less than a first-year teacher at Carlmont High School in Belmont.

By the time Migdail left, the cost of benefits had risen so much that it almost equated to his take-home pay.
“I did not think that you could find a job that paid less than nonprofit publishing,” his wife had joked, referring to his previous profession. During his last year, he was making about $57,671. Three years later, his salary went up to $94,975 while at Carlmont High School. 

During one of the first assemblies at his new district, Migdail recognized a third of his colleagues as having once worked at South San Francisco High School.

As part of the new school year, a three-day teacher training was held to familiarize the new staff with the school's culture. Migdail sat next to a former South San Francisco High School teacher. On the final day of the training, when personnel matters were discussed, the two began to cry. The stark difference between their previous workplace and their new one had shocked them.

“There’s no question that it’s a mark of inequity throughout the system,” Migdail said.

**California’s school funding formula**

Pay disparities between districts have been a long-standing issue in California, and several measures have been taken in the past to address it.

In 2013, the state legislature passed the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), which aimed to provide more funding to school districts with higher levels of student poverty, English language learners and foster youth. This allowed for more local control over how funds were used, providing school districts with greater flexibility on how to use funding, including increasing teacher salaries.

Yet despite the apparent financial stability of SSFUSD by LCFF standards –– in receiving enough funding from the local community to meet or exceed the minimum funding level set by the state –– the district still struggles to keep up with the Bay Area’s high cost of living and with well-funded schools in nearby wealthier areas.

The significantly higher property taxes of districts in Atherton and San Mateo –– which were approximately 62% more last year –– illustrate why their teacher salaries exceed those in SSFUSD.

Property taxes are a key factor in determining how much funding a school district receives, as they make up a significant portion of the revenue. SSFUSD is also a Unified School District, which means it serves students in grades K-12. As a result, the funding formulas for SSFUSD and High School Districts in San Mateo County differ. 

“There's no way we could compete with the Union High School Districts because they naturally get more revenue than K-12 or elementary school districts,” said Ted O, Assistant Superintendent of Business Services at SSFUSD.

According to John Baker, former board trustee president of SSFUSD, the city's growing biotech industry has led to increased property revenue every year. The district has, therefore, been able to moderately increase salaries as well as rates for other teacher gigs, like after school tutoring.

While this has helped to narrow the salary disparity with other districts in recent years, teachers are still left underpaid with many leaving for reasons beyond pay.

**Impact on students**

Students also feel the weight of teacher turnover. 

Constant churning of staff not only negatively impacts achievement for students in a new teacher’s classroom, but for all the students at the school, according to research from the American Educational Research Journal. Rates are also highest in schools serving low-income communities and students of color. 

At Sequoia Union High School District in Redwood City, over half of the students met or exceeded the standard of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress test (CAASPP) in 2021. In comparison, only 25.79% of students at SSFUSD met or exceeded the math portion of the test and 65.43% for the English/Language Art Literacy portion.

Marcie Mitchell, the librarian at South San Francisco High School, has also noticed turnover impacts future generations of teachers and the school’s external relationships with teaching programs.

Many student-teachers from Stanford University used to come teach at South San Francisco High School. Lately, this hasn’t been the case, Mitchell noticed. 

“When I asked my AP classes, who here wants to be a teacher, nobody ever raises their hand,” said Rhonda Clements, a history teacher at South San Francisco High School.

**A state issue** 

Despite efforts by districts like SSFUSD to address high teacher turnover with modest salary increases, the root cause of the problem could be linked to California's funding levels for education.

While the LCFF is designed to address inequities and provide more resources to schools with higher needs, the state still has lower funding levels overall than many other states.

In 2021, California ranked 17th out of 41 states in its funding level, spending $15,017 per student in state and local funding, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This is just $329 more than the national average of $14,668 and about 38% less than the per-pupil funding in Washington D.C.

California’s high cost of living also means that the state can afford fewer teachers, staff and resources, making it more difficult for the state to provide the same level of funding per student as other states.

In addition, many districts in California, like SSFUSD, have been experiencing declining enrollment due to lower birth rates and as more families are leaving the state and enrolling their kids in schools in more affordable areas. 

The amount of money that California school districts receive from the state or federal government is determined by a per-pupil formula. Therefore, if the number of students enrolled in a district decreases, the district may receive less funding.

This past year, Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a plan to direct funding to the state’s poorest schools and target racial disparities statewide, acknowledging that school districts’ efforts under the LCFF have not narrowed achievement gaps. 

Recent state level changes in funding, as well as emergency funds from the pandemic, have also bolstered budgets and provided more resources for technology and employee retention. 

“Sad that some of these changes took a pandemic to bring about,” Mitchell said.

**The teachers who leave**

When Daphne Pacia-McCann was 23, she accepted her first teaching position at South San Francisco High School. Having graduated from the district, she accepted the offer immediately and was greeted by the principal with a “welcome home.” 

As a woman of color, she loved that her students looked like her, and she admired the school’s strong sense of community.

During the pandemic, however, Pacia-McCann made the decision to leave South San Francisco High School after her husband lost his job and their child’s health insurance. In order to secure insurance for her family through SSFUSD, she would have had to pay nearly $800 each month per family member.

Although her husband swiftly found new employment, the experience was stressful enough to convince Pacia-McCann that she needed to work somewhere that would provide more security for her family. She ultimately accepted a teaching position at Tide Academy in Menlo Park, where the district offers fully paid medical benefits with family coverage included.

“COVID-19 was the tipping point,” Pacia-McCann said. “It was at that point that I decided to leave a place I loved in order to find employment that would insure my family.”

Her last day at South San Francisco High School was via distance learning at the height of lockdown. Her students and colleagues left her sweet messages through email and in her digital yearbook. When they later graduated, she attended their in-person ceremony and felt at home again.

“Three years later, I still have not seen the kind of camaraderie amongst students that I saw daily at South San Francisco High School,” she added.

In two-teacher households, choosing a job with better pay versus better benefits is often a balancing act.

Despite him having a master’s degree and more teaching experience, South San Francisco High School Italian teacher Julianne Franceschi’s husband makes less money than her, teaching at a middle school in a nearby district.

The benefits package at his district in Pacifica, however, covers a full Kaiser family plan, which helps take care of their kids' insurance.

During contract negotiations with the Teacher's Association, higher pay is often favored over better benefits as it can help all teachers, not just those without existing insurance coverage for their families.

The latest contract agreement between the union and district resulted in a 4.5% salary increase beginning in the 2023-24 school year followed by a 3% salary increase in the 2024-25 school year.

According to the district, it's too costly for SSFUSD to provide full family coverage for health insurance, leaving teachers with poor pay and benefits.

Recently, SSFUSD has started covering the increased rates for individual employees with Kaiser health insurance, which is something the union had been pushing for years. But for those starting families, it still isn’t enough.

While benefits are a major factor in many teachers' decisions to stay or leave, others are also grappling with the high cost of living in the Bay Area.

According to Mitchell, several new out-of-state teacher applicants decline job offers at South San Francisco High School due to the area's high living expenses.

And while some teachers choose to commute from as far as 55 miles away in Antioch, others opt to leave the state entirely.

Joe Reichert served as the band director at South San Francisco High School in 2015. At the time, he and his wife were paying $1,000 for a single room in San Jose, where they shared an apartment with a friend.

After his wife became pregnant, they realized they wouldn't be able to afford living in the Bay Area, let alone buying a house, which they had dreamed of. At the end of his first year at South San Francisco High School, Reichert made the tough decision to leave the school and the band he had helped rebuild and move to Dallas.

"If we stay, we'll never own a home. We'll only rent for the rest of our lives," Reichert's wife had told him.

Although his salary dropped significantly at his new teaching job in Dallas, Reichert was able to rent a 3-bedroom house for only $1,800. Eventually, he was able to buy their own home.

As of March, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in South San Francisco is $2,390, according to Zumper. The price has gone up about 27% since 2016.

Last November, a bond passed that would set aside $75 million to construct local affordable rental housing for teachers and staff in South San Francisco. The units would be built on the site of an elementary school that closed in 1992.

Baker said that in other districts where housing for staff had been built, including Jefferson Union High School District in Daly City, it had helped with recruitment and retention. 

While most see staff housing as a step in the right direction, some have expressed concerns about the stability and potential conflicts of interest that could arise from having an employer also act as a landlord.

If a new teacher were to lose their job before receiving tenure, for instance, they would lose their home as well, having 90 days to move upon their final contractual day with the district.

Those already living in Jefferson Union High School District’s staff housing can only live there for five years, meaning they would have to eventually find a home of their own. 

Teachers at higher paying districts aren’t immune to the Bay Area’s expensive housing either. Several teachers at Sequoia Union High School District in Atherton commute two hours or more to work each day. 

“The higher pay scale does not protect us against that problem,” said Edith Salvatore, Spanish teacher and union president at Sequoia Union High School District. 

**The teachers who stay**

Clements has been teaching at South San Francisco High School for 17 years. She’s taught AP U.S. History and Health, sustained the school’s History Day Program and Earth Club, and helped build outdoor learning spaces during the pandemic. 

She’s also taken on various part-time gigs to help pay the bills and support her family.

Clements has taught six classes a day, waitressed on the weekends, ran homework center, supervised Saturday school, and served as department chair. She’s also had a tutoring business on the side when she first started at South San Francisco High School.

Before teaching, she ran an advertising agency and had worked in educational marketing. Her 10 years of experience, however, equated to nothing when she became a teacher.

Having worked at the school for many years, she hasn’t considered leaving the district as she doesn’t want to start over and lose her tenure. She’s mindful that when teachers leave, their programs do as well. 

“I’m so scared that when I leave, History Day will go away, that Earth Club will go away. There won’t be the same sort of support for those programs,” Clements said. 

Still, she realizes the sacrifices and difficult choices she’s had to make to stay teaching at the school.

“I'm really happy I didn't have another child,” she added. “Otherwise I would have lived a life of extraordinary poverty, and I probably would have had to quit teaching.”

**The teachers who come back**

Despite the appeal of neighboring districts, South San Francisco High School’s strong working-class and diverse community has made it difficult for teachers to leave.

Maria Ramirez, a Spanish teacher at South San Francisco High School, started a program in 2011 for native speakers, where students who spoke the language at home could take Language Arts classes in Spanish.

The program caters to the school’s large Latino population and has about 130 students enrolling in the two classes each year.

In 2017, she left South San Francisco High School to teach at Capuchino High School in San Mateo for better pay and for their international baccalaureate program. 

She felt terrible leaving but reassured her students that it had nothing to do with them and that she just wanted to try something new.

While at Capuchino, she was assigned to teach beginner-level Spanish, which didn't allow her to develop professionally in the way she had hoped to.

At the same time, her former students stayed in touch with her, keeping her up to date about the state of the Native Spanish speakers' program. Despite the efforts of other Spanish teachers to maintain it, the program eventually fell through without Ramirez. 

“I need to come back otherwise the program is going to die,” Ramirez said.

After two years at Capuchino, she returned to South San Francisco High School and resurrected the program. As the only immigrant teacher from Latin America at the school, she was happy to come back as she feels a sense of obligation to not only help share the language but also the culture with her students.

Throughout her career, she’s noticed a lot of her colleagues leave South San Francisco High School but rarely come back. 

“They have families to support, so that's why they leave,” she said.


# Data Diary

## Data Sources 

In this project, I’m using four data sources.

1. **Turnover Rate in SSFUSD**

This data was obtained through a public record request to South San Francisco Unified School District. I also obtained data for the number of active teachers at the two high schools from the California Department of Education.


2. **Salary Rates among San Mateo County School Districts**

I obtained this data from the California Department of Education. I focused only on the high school districts and unified school districts in San Mateo County, as I am interested in looking at high school teachers specifically. I also excluded La Honda-Pescadero Unified School District, as it is a significally smaller district than the others. The salaries have also been adjusted for inflation to show more accurately how the salaries have changed over the years.

3. **CAASPP Test Results for SSFUSD and SUHSD**

This data was obtained from the California Department of Education. I focused on these two districts to see if there would be a significant difference between a district with more money.


4. **Per-Pupil Funding Levels in the U.S.**  

Finally, I obtained this data from the U.S. Census Annual Survey of School System Finances. This data only shows information for 41 states as the data is still being collected. 


## Data Cleaning

1.  I combined the teacher termination data set I had received from the district with the number of active teachers data set from the California DOE to get a more accurate picture of how many teachers were leaving each year. I divided the number of terminations by the number of active teachers using a formula in Google Sheets. I filtered out substitute/temporary teachers as well as non-teacher positions. I was hoping to compare this data with the termination data from one of the higher paying districts — however, after much consideration and cleaning, I felt that their data set was not reliable or accurate enough to include. 

<img width="1118" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 8 07 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98369114/235571511-d7fd8de5-bb38-4c10-b1d3-27d0529f2c25.png">
<img width="552" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 8 07 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98369114/235571520-1932f524-d636-452c-8e61-32c3e78835a7.png">

2. The salary data was pulled from a large data set that contained the salaries for every school in California. I filtered out only the districts I wanted to focus on for each year and adjusted for inflation. 

3. This dataset was fairly straightforward, so I just manually put the numbers for the test results into a Google Spreadsheet.

<img width="460" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 8 08 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98369114/235571620-7e41e610-2015-4600-a1a9-9ab1128e6b5e.png">

4. This data was also straightforward as I just downloaded the file from the U.S. Census Annual Survey of School System Finances and found the section for per-pupil funding information. 

<img width="897" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 8 10 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98369114/235571819-cbbb68d9-a71c-4080-9351-adeef27f23ec.png">


## Reporting Questions and Answers

1. What is the average teacher turnover rate for South San Francisco Unified School District?

After dividing the number of terminations by the number of total teachers each year, the average termination rate for high school teachers in South San Francisco Unified School District is about 14%. 

2. What are the differences in teacher salaries in San Mateo County school districts? 

The chart shows this best, but San Mateo Union High and Sequoia Union High pay significally higher than the other school districts in San Mateo County. Based on my reporting, this is due to these districts having higher property taxes. South San Francisco Unified School District is in the middle range while Jefferson Union High and Cabrillo Unified have the lowest salaries in the county. 


3. How do students at South San Francisco Unified School District perform academically compared to students at Sequoia Union High School District, a wealthier school district?

Students at Sequoia Union High District overall perform better than students at SSFUSD. This might be due to the fact that those schools are better funded and have more resources. 

5. How does California rank compared to other states in its education funding?

Based on the data from 2021, California ranks at number 17. However, this data only has information for 41 states, so that number might change once the other remaining states are included. Still, California spends 38% less than the $24,535 in per-pupil funding in Washington D.C.
